# FLC-Lib
Fuzzy Logic Controller library.

This is a standard fuzzy controller library that is presently in beta.
COG (Center of Gravity) defuzzification is supported, as well as logical AND and OR implications. 

The following is an example of how to use the library correctly.
  ```
  /* initialize the library*/
	Fuzzy fuzz = new Fuzzy();
  ```
  Initialize the Linguistic Variables by specifying, Name,Type and Range.
```
		fuzz.add_input("Density", "input", "0, 35");
		fuzz.add_input("Speed", "input", "0, 65");
		fuzz.add_input("Steer", "output", "-180, 180");
```
Then, for each Linguistic Variable, we assign the required memberset functions by describing the type of the variable.
input, input name, the memberset's name, and its range
The range may be defined by providing three values (Trimf - Triangle) separated by a comma (,) or four values.
(Tramf - Trapezoid) 
  
```
		fuzz.add_memberset("input", "Density", "low", "-10, 0, 10, 15");
		fuzz.add_memberset("input", "Density", "mid", "10, 15, 25,30");
		fuzz.add_memberset("input", "Density", "high", "25, 30, 35, 40");
		fuzz.add_memberset("input", "Speed", "low", "-10, 0, 20, 41");
		fuzz.add_memberset("input", "Speed", "mid", "20, 41, 60");
		fuzz.add_memberset("input", "Speed", "high", "41, 60, 65, 70");
		fuzz.add_memberset("output", "Steer", "right", "10, 20, 30, 40");
		fuzz.add_memberset("output", "Steer", "zero", "40, 50, 60, 70");
		fuzz.add_memberset("output", "Steer", "left", "70, 80, 90, 100");
```
Finally we have to define the rules for our system. They are defined as simple strings in the format shown
	below.
	(IF "Input name" is "memberset name" <and>.... THEN "input name" is "memberset name").
	
```
		fuzz.add_rule("IF Density is low And Speed is high Then Steer is zero");
		fuzz.add_rule("IF Density is low And Speed is mid Then Steer is left");
		fuzz.add_rule("IF Density is low And Speed is low Then Steer is left");
		fuzz.add_rule("IF Density is mid And Speed is low Then Steer is left");
		fuzz.add_rule("IF Density is mid And Speed is high Then Steer is right");
		fuzz.add_rule("IF Density is high And Speed is low Then Steer is right");
		fuzz.add_rule("IF Density is high And Speed is high Then Steer is right");
```
To get the crisp values generated by the controller, we need to use the calc results() function, which accepts a string as an input.
The string must contain the values for each defined input, separated by a comma (,). 
        
```
		for(Double d : fuzz.calc_results("10,20"))
		{
			System.out.format("The output is %f%n",d);
		}
```
Subsequently, to retrieve the triggered rules, we should call the active_rules() method which returns a list
	of strings containing the triggered rules.
	
```
		for (String s : fuzz.active_rules())
		{
			System.out.println(s);
		}
```
